This repository contains my solutions for 20 core Java problems. 
It demonstrates my ability to write clean, structured, and object-oriented code while applying key concepts:  

âœ… Classes & Objects  
âœ… Constructors & Overloading  
âœ… Static Variables, Methods & Blocks  
âœ… Getters & Setters  
âœ… Encapsulation & Reusability  
âœ… Real-world problem-solving with Java  

ðŸ“Œ Each problem is implemented in a separate Java file for clarity.
